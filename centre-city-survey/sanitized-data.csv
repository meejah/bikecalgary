Separated bike lanes and a wholistic integration of E-W and N-S bike routes across the river (10th and 14th street bridges primarily and Peace/Prince's Island etc.) would help tremendously.  At present, it's a dangerous hodgepodge of sidewalks, car-heavy roads, and multiple routes to get between Hillhurst/Sunnyside, Bridgeland, the Beltline, Connaught, 17th Ave, Mount Royal, Inglewood, Sunalta, or Ramsey.  Just cycling from Hillhurst to the Library or Mission is an exercise in frustration, one-way roads, dangerous interactions with cars, and narrow bridges, for instance.  

Two-way bike lanes on one-way roads would be a huge benefit. Huge.
Bike-friendly areas ahead of cross-walks (like Vancouver's) where bikes can turn ahead of traffic would be another plus.  
And what about integrating the pathways with on-road paths?

I think the key to making this work and not angering drivers more than necessary is to put the bike lanes on secondary roads that SHOULDN'T be used by cars as a thoroughfare. When I visited Vancouver for the Olympics, I borrowed a bike to ride to all of the events. They have fantastic lanes on side roads that run parallel to the main roads. They have crossing lights at major intersections with main roads (not immediate like pedestrian lights but delayed like a traffic light) and you can press the button to cross without getting offe of your bike. Also, they basically make it such that cars don't want to be on roads where bikes are because the roads are annoyingly slow to drive on. Also, Calgary might consider something like Montreal where certain bike lanes are seasonal.

Wherever possible install traffic signalling systems that can be programmed so that it adjusts to changing lights faster when there is very low volume road traffic time periods.  

Have alot more pedestrian-cyclist activated traffic lights. This will cut down the impatience of EVERYONE --even the car drivers waiting around (too long) when no one is crossing the intersection.

Additionally, most houses that face 5th St also have available street parking on the corresponding side-streets, so this makes sense. 5th is well-used by cyclists but because of street parking, it's always a tight fit for me, or I'm forced to take the lane which drivers sometimes feel impedes them.

Finally, the alternative to 5th St for crossing downtown is 4th, or 2nd (14th, South of the tracks, can be useful for people as well since it connects to the reservoir dam bridge, but a bike lane there would be most useful going UP the hill, after 17th. Something to consider!). 

There are bike lanes on 2nd but this route is less than optimal because it does not connect, additionally the lanes are not well-separated and I've often been ""almost hit"" by side-traffic who does not see me. I consider the bike lanes on 2nd to be the most dangerous in the city.

A wide, well-marked bike lane on 5th would make the most sense, motorized vehicle traffic is also already only one lane there. Please consider removing street parking for bike lanes! Parking spots downtown are very expensive, so it's not clear to me why the city should subsidize people who have multiple cars and nowhere to park them in cases like this! Please remove street parking and put well-marked bike lanes on 5th Avenue, they will be well-used and well-appreciated by both drivers and cyclists.

Finally, in order to put a lane in on 4th you would need to eliminate street parking there which is very very important for those businesses.

35-44,Confident,Male,,,,,,,"Since ""new"" neighborhoods aren't built on a grid system anymore, why isn't cycling infrastructure put in place initially instead of waiting for the density to grow and then fit it in with the space left over.  Grid systems are relatively easy to work around after the fact with much more creativity available but the windy twisty roads that don't go anywhere direct which are prevalent in city neighborhoods since about the 80s make it pretty tough to fit anything else into the area.
I commute from and to communities along the north edge of the city and usually I am on roads with no sidewalk or shoulder.  Some of the road edges have trails worn into the grass from people walking or riding showing that there is interest in transportation other than cars - and this when you are fighting traffic for space or walking through mud!  These are the determined fearless people wearing these trails in.  If some of those barriers were removed, I wonder who else would consider it.  
I have spoken to the city about this and they say that they have no intention of doing anything until there is a demand for it.  The person built paths are not enough evidence.  It seems to me in the cost of building a neighborhood paths and sidewalks are small costs and then they are in place when people need to start using them and the city isn't scrambling 10 years down the road to try to figure out how to make them fit.  Also you get great buy-in from drivers because the paths/lanes/routes/etc have always been there and it has always been like that so no one gripes that their lane has been made narrower or they can't park on the shoulder anymore - it is all behaviour that has been in place since the neighborhood was built.

After being struck by a car, I believe I can fully appreciate the importance of separate cycling facilities for the safety of cyclists and the sanity of drivers. 

I am very concerned with the 10th Ave and 14th St SW addition of traffic lights. I do understand and appreciate the desire to transform 10th Ave to a major arterial road contributing road by allowing drivers to navigate to and from major routes such as 14th St and Crowchild. 

However, 10th avenue has been identified as part of the cycling routes for the city of Calgary. The addition of onstreet parking, the elimination of the bike lane at 10th and 14th st in favour of a right hand turn lane, and increase in volume will make the route less safe for other users. The change of 10th ave to a major East-West artery in the City Centre will result in increased expectations from drivers, more cyclist-driver interaction, and reduced spacing for cyclists. This is counter to the plan to use 10th ave as a cycling route. 

The current construction, though there is mention of a sidewalk that has not been initiated, does not appear to include improvements for other users in the area including dedicated cycling lanes, a pathway, a pathway beneath 14th St or dedicated cycling facility to cross under the rail and Bow Trail bridges. 

It would appear that despite the Sunalta Area Redevelopment Plan statement to review the needs of users other than drivers, specifically cyclists, in this area (2009), the recent construction is entirely focused on motor vehicle traffic. This issue should be revisited along with the actions taken according to the Sunalta Area Redevelopment Plan in order to provide emphasis on all users for future projects and to revisit the current projects underway.

Most roads in this city have plenty of room for cyclists if only they would stop riding on the sidewalks and start riding safely in traffic.  Also driver education and respect play a large role.  If drivers would treat people like valuable human beings then we'd all be a lot safer.  Cyclist and Driver Education is of much more importance in my opinion.  Secondly would be a strong enforcement role by police for both cyclists and drivers.  If we'd all play by the rules it would be a lot easier.  By taking away driving lanes and providing discontinuous and confusing bike lanes for cyclists with poor skills I don't think it is helping the cause.  

Many routes through the Center City could easily lose a lane and have a bike lane added to either side.  This INCLUDES one way streets/ave's as well.  Cyclists need to be able to ride on BOTH side of the road on a one way.  It should be very easy to leave the parking as is on these streets, add a bike lane to each side, and still have lanes down the middle.

The 10st NW bike lane project is kind of embarassing and is a perfect example of good intent mixed with bad planning and poor implementation.  Who painted those lines anyway?  Are city crews not capable of painting a straight line?  10 st had plenty of room for bikes to share the road with cars as it was.  Now cars are just going to hate us for screwing up traffic even more as they drive by these bike lanes that are barely used most of the day.

10 st is also an example of where sidewalk space could have been reduced, or moved over, instead of a lane of traffic.  I'm not a civil engineer but wouldn't it also have been possible to take back a bit of sidewalk space here and achieve the same result but leave all 4 lanes of traffic?  I think there are many areas in the city where sidewalks and boulevards could be altered to provide space for on-street bike lanes without inconveniencing drivers.

To truly reduce vehicle traffic congestion the city must increase bike lanes and/or lane width for cyclists WITHOUT removing vehicle lanes.",,Yes,Always,Always,Often,Rarely,Rarely,"Epcor Arts Center, Chumir Center, various other points",Bridgeland

It isn't clear here if there would be bi-directional routes for bicycles on one ways, or if the bicycle infrastructure would then follow only the current flow of traffic.  The easy thing would have been to mark all of them, because I feel that every route needs that infrastracture eventually, especially going under the underpasses.  A bicyclist is much more sensitive and has greater generalized costs than a vehicle driver if they have to go an extra block or two to cross underneath safely.  Thus, every possible route should be made attractive eventually.  Intuition might also say that the less busy roads should see this first, but I would disagree as bicyclists already feel somewhat safe when riding on the road itself in such cases, ie. 2nd Ave or Eau Claire ave.  Putting additional infrastructure there is thus not ideally making use of it.  Furthermore, those are also not very direct routes or as well connected to activity zones like the main avenues are, ie 6th and 9th Ave.  Bicyclists too, need direct routes.  Don't hesitate taking away elbow room from the vehicular traffic.

The presence of dedicated bike lanes will not change my bike habits much, however I am concerned about the negative impact they have on drivers.  Example:  10th street north is now 3 car lanes and two bike lanes.  Why was a north-bound (uphill) bike lane put in when there is a very wide and rarely-used sidewalk there?  My concern is that drivers will be MORE angry  because of traffic slow-downs, and will blame cyclists (because of the bike lanes).  Speaking with a colleague (very much a non-cyclist) yesterday, he said what makes him most angry is when cyclists behave stupidly in traffic - cutting drivers off for example - or making rapid, dangerous moves like biking across a pedestrian crosswalk in front of traffic. He also ranted at the uselessness of bike lanes in a city with 6 months of winter, and of never seeing bikers in those lanes.  It's important to understand the perspective of the (majority) motorist, all of whom just want to get where they are going. 

Would suggest ""driver / cyclist co-education courses"" - that it, teaching bike commuters how to ride in traffic and also teaching drivers how to share the road.

Also, ""bike lanes"" that also double as parking spaces along bike routes are rather useless. Cyclists are forced to ride in the adjacent lanes to avoid parked cars and busses.

- i think we need to make a serious effort to connect the centre city to the Beltline. There are thousands of people who walk right now because cycling is dangerous. Right now the only safe way in is 11 st sw -> 8 ave sw -> ??? All other routes are quite scary.
- 17th ave sw should have bike lanes on it on both sides. No trucks on 17th ave sw! Only one side of the road should have parking.
- 14 ave sw is already very welll used - connecting the Stampede to Sunalta.
- 11 ave sw and 12 ave sw are very wide and could easily accomodate a bike lane in each direction.
- 3 ave sw is a great option to get people on bikes off the crowded Eau Claire area.

It is a scary one to transverse, but sometimes there is no choice other efficient coming from Scarboro.

The 1 St SE and SW are roads  I  also use frequently -- they are not the safest and I choose the sidewalk during some hairy traffic mornings, but I prefer to ride the road --- it would be nice to see some changes to these routes to include safer cycling options --- I also see a lot of cyclists that use these routes during rush hour also.

I use 13,15 and 16 ave frequently to traverse the inner city East to West, to avoid traffic and they are quite safe -- except more room for both cars and cycles could be made ( less cars parked?)  

I also use Cameron Ave and Royal Ave a lot to traverse the inner city  East to West, on the south side of 17th Ave SW -- I see a lot of cyclists on those routes.

Also, 10 ave and such cycling lanes, need to be seperated from the parked cars.

These main auto routes should be the focus because generally speaking, most sidestreets are safe to ride on without cycling facilities and thus do not require investment. Take for example crossing on having to traverse along a major thoroughfare such as 5th St SW between 9 Ave and 17 Ave during rushhour: it is generally rife with the most impatient or negligent of drivers at that time, and it's borderline treacherous to cross it except for dismounting and behaving as a pedestrian. Now consider doing this across all of the major thoroughfares in the core on your way to work - not terribly convenient for a cyclist, not terribly encouraging to ridership!

Depending on which route is chosen for a N-S entry route into the city centre would impact which routes are made into bike routes.  Today there are only two real entrances from the south that are safe into centre city and that is the Elbow River pathway on the East and 11th street on the west All other routes require significant fearlessness on the part of riders and explains the low current number of users. As well creating dedicated lanes would result in reducing bike car conflict as bicycle riders may become less erratic.

Also, ""bike lanes"" that also double as parking spaces along bike routes are rather useless. Cyclists are forced to ride in the adjacent lanes to avoid parked cars and busses. One suggestion is to make the road and pathway in this order (from the centre of the street working towards the curbs): Road-Bus lane and parking-Bike lane-sidewalk.
